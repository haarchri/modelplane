"""The cloud half of the stack for Civo.

No generator covers Civo, so Modelplane pins the cloud half by hand,
in the same shape a generator emits. Where a component also appears on
a generated cloud, this file states the same pin, so one review moves
both halves.

Civo pre-installs no GPU stack: its GPU node images ship the NVIDIA
container toolkit but no driver, and there is no managed GPU Operator
add-on (unlike Vultr's). So this is the one hand-written cloud that
installs the GPU Operator itself: driver enabled (the operator's
containerized driver installs to /run/nvidia/driver), toolkit disabled
(baked into the node image), and device plugin disabled so its
nvidia.com/gpu ledger never books the same physical devices the DRA
driver's ResourceSlices allocate - the DRA driver stays the sole GPU
allocator. compose-civo-cluster composes no GPU readiness gate (the
operator it would observe is installed here, after the cluster XR is
Ready - gating would deadlock), so the operator chart's wait=True and
the DRA driver's depends_on are what keep GPU health on the critical
path.

    """The component list with the given pools' GPU driver loading NVLink
    disabled, leaving every other pool's driver untouched.

    Civo's single-H100 sizes are lone H100 SXM modules whose NVLink links
    have no peer: link bring-up fails and the driver never becomes ready
    unless loaded with NVreg_NvLinkDisable=1 (per Civo's GPU configuration
    docs, validated against GPU Operator v25.10.1). The parameter must not
    reach multi-GPU pools, whose GPUs NVLink interconnects, so the
    gpu-operator chart switches to NVIDIADriver-managed drivers: the
    chart's default NVIDIADriver (deployDefaultCR) keeps driving every GPU
    node not claimed by a more specific instance, and one NVIDIADriver per
    listed pool claims that pool's nodes - same driver pin as the chart's,
    plus the kernel module ConfigMap carrying the parameter.

    The per-pool NVIDIADrivers gate on the gpu-operator release (their CRD
    ships with it) and the DRA driver gates on them, so GPU health stays
    on the critical path: a pool whose driver never loads holds its
    NVIDIADriver's status.state off ready, which holds back the DRA
    driver exactly like an unhealthy operator does today.
